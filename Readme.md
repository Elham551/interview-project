## Development Steps

Below is the step-by-step approach I followed to develop this project:

1. **Backend Setup:** Initial configuration and setup of the backend
   environment.
2. **Implementation of Process Shares Method:** Developed the logic to handle
   post-processing of shared data.
3. **Separation of Routes and Controllers:** Organized the code by separating
   routes and controllers from `main.ts`.
4. **Implementation of Body Controllers:** Created and structured body
   controllers for handling requests.
5. **Writing Backend Tests:** Developed unit and integration tests to ensure the
   stability of the backend logic.
6. **Frontend Structure:** Built the frontend project structure to organize
   components and maintain clarity.
7. **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Added Tailwind CSS as preferred
8. **Creating Types and Datatable Components:** Defined TypeScript types and
   built reusable datatable components.
9. **AddEmployee Component:** Developed a dedicated component for adding new
   employee data.
10. **Post Employee Logic Implementation:** Implemented the logic to handle post
    requests for employee data.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would have focused on the following enhancements to the
project:

1. **Backend Validation for Unique Post IDs:** Implement a robust validation
   method in the backend to ensure that duplicate post IDs are not allowed,
   while still supporting unique names for each post entry.
2. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - **Backend:** Write additional unit and integration tests to cover all
     critical functionalities and edge cases.
   - **Frontend:** Increase test coverage for components and interactions,
     ensuring stable and reliable user experiences.
